## Notes on Docker

Docker allows for the creation of containers to highly customize how you run applications. 

The notes below are for an already composed container:

### `docker compose ps`

- displays currently running services

### `docker compose up`

- builds and starts the docker container
- adding `-d` runs it in the background

### `docker compose down`

- stops containers started with `up`

### `docker compose logs`

- shows log output from containers

### `docker compose pull`

- pulls latest service image
